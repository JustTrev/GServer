GMOD Dedicated Server

Hey everyone. So I recently got bored and decided to designed a lightweight app for Garry’s Mod dedicated server. I haven’t really seen anyone else make a tool for GMOD S because they probably don't want GUI's so I decided well what the heck, how about I go for it anyways..

I am still working on bugs and other features and will continue to over time. You can download my latest version off my blog.

Those that want to help contribute may also do so!  I also would like to see what you guys come up with for the icon design for the program as well, which can be funny or clever, or other features from suggestions you might want to see in it.

I wanted to share this tool and make it apart of the community as well, and help make it fully versatile to fit your needs when hosting your own GMOD server. I have seen enough videos on how to setup your own by using batch files which are easy enough when you know what your doing at least, but digging around in the folders can also potentially break your server if you’re not careful though (if like for example its your first time doing it..)

So thanks everyone, and I am looking forward to continue working on this and looking forward from your feedback as well.

Thanks,
